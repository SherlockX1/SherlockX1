- 👋 Hi, I’m @SherlockX1
- 👀 I’m interested in coding ( obviously), and love playing (and watching) football, cricket, tennis and badminton. I'm an avid reader of crime fiction - yh, Anthony Horowitz, John Grisham, Conan Doyle, Lee Child and Agatha Christie are my favourite authors (so far). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python 3 and Java
- 💞️ Could do with a PP (Python Partner), will start the full stack engineer course soon on codecademy, could pair up with someone on that too.
- 📫 How to reach me: My discord is 6c#9302. I live in England, and currently I'm in first year at uni.
